📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Customer Churn Prediction System using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on historical behavioral and demographic data.

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
